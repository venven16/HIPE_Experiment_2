    "\n",
    "- In data analytics, normalization is an essential preprocessing method, particularly for statistical and machine learning applications. Scaling and centering the data are involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Subtracting each data point's mean from the total is referred to as centering. By taking this step, the data's mean of zero is guaranteed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The process of dividing the centered data by the standard deviation is called scaling. By doing this, the data are standardized to have a standard deviation of 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- By ensuring that the data is on a consistent scale, this method helps minimize bias towards features with bigger sizes and enhances the performance of numerous machine learning methods.\n",
